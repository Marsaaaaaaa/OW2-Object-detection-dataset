# OW2-Object-detection-dataset

uc release in yolo darknet format.


The dataset has 2 classes being enemy name and enemy model,
The Github repo is resized to 720p and corresponds to v12 of the roboflow dataset


Roboflow link to export in different formats, 1080p and future updates: https://app.roboflow.com/untitled-project-obum0/proj-f/overview.

Also includes roboflow's "pre trained model" of an older version of the dataset, its not great but fun to play with I guess: https://app.roboflow.com/untitled-project-obum0/proj-f/deploy/6.
